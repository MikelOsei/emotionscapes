Emotionscapes is an interactive web-based digital art project that attempts to critique the way we interact with social media by mimicking our emotions in a landscape. Users interact with the page by reacting and responding to "randomly" pulled online posts (i.e., memes, ads, media), which influences the colors, overall mood, weather and tone of the landscape in real time. This project explores the intersection of social media, data, and digital identity.

This web app was built with React, Next.js, and Firebase for real-time updates across all devices.

Created for UWaterloo's FINE257 Creation Project - Winter 2025, by Mikel Osei-Owusu.
